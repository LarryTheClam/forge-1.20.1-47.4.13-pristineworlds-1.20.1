Hello!

I am Will (known online commonly as Larry the Clam, Hafnium, or Sulfide) and this is the repository for a Forge 1.20.1 Minecraft Mod I'm working on!

It is primarily something that I am pursuing out of self-interest (i.e. I am adding stuff I find enjoyable, or fun, or interesting), but I am always open to suggestions as to what I should add!  Ultimately I want to add a little bit of everything, trees, biomes, ores, etc; proving I am able to build a mod, but also to make something comprehensive and fun!
